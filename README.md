This is a project from an online course that I am taking to supplement and reinforce the coding that I learned at an in-class Full Stack bootcamp that I recently completed. This particular sample site was just too cute to just have it hidden in some subfolder of one of my repos so I transferred the files over to its own repo. 

This sample site reinforces the use of BootStrap and basic CSS to achieve a simple yet elegantly designed website that can easily meet the needs of most businesses today. Below is an image of what this website renders as:
